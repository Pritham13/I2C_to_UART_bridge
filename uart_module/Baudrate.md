# UART Bit Rate Calculation

This document provides the calculation for the bit rate of a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) based on its baud rate.

## Understanding Baud Rate vs. Bit Rate

- **Baud Rate**: The number of signal changes or symbols per second.
- **Bit Rate**: The number of bits transmitted per second.

For UART communication, the baud rate usually equals the bit rate, assuming each signal change (symbol) represents one bit.

## Calculation

Given:
- **UART Baud Rate** = 115200 baud

Since each baud in a typical UART configuration corresponds to one bit:


Bit Rate = Baud Rate = 115200  bits per second
